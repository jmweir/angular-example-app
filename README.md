## Angular.js Example Application

This is a basic Angular.JS application meant to highlight Angular's different features. Given the name of a city, weather forecast data
is fetched and displayed from openweathermap.org. The application is developed incrementally over six iterations.  

View the individual README files within each iteration for build steps.
